This directory contains various patches to the distribution that were
either couldn't be wedged into the configure script due to system
dependancies or weren't worth getting into the configure script (laziness
plays a large part here).  They are "not supported", meaning we didn't try
them and don't use them for whatever reasons.

Please send bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.


If you wish to submit a patch, please submit either unified or context
diffs; plain diffs are hard to apply if the source has changed.
