This is the Carnegie Mellon University Cyrus IMAP Server.

****
NOTE
****

This distribution is an early release containing many new features
that have not been thoroughly tested. A more stable Cyrus distribution
can be found at
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24.tar.gz

However, no further development work will progress on 1.6 so we
encourage you to work with the Cyrus 2.0 code wherever possible. 

If you continue to install this PLEASE be sure to read the
documentation as a number of items have changed.  Please also refer
to docs/bugs.html for any outstanding bugs with the current release.
