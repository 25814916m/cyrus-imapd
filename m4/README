This directory holds extra m4 files used by autoreconf to generate aclocal.m4.
At the moment these are the libtoolize copied files that should be supplied
with source distributions and/or before autoreconf is applied.  To add or
refresh the libtool files:

	$ cd /directory/with/configure
	$ libtoolize --copy --install
