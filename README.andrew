You need to run autoconf before building.  "configure" is no longer in the
repository because it's built from "configure.in", and it's really annoying
to keep checking it in only to realize that you don't understand the changes
because they're all autoconf spew.

to build configure:
   aclocal -I cmulocal ; autoconf

to build:
   smake init all 

then, as admin (suid binaries on AFS)
   smake -d install

If you get the error 'can not find sources', make sure imap/imap.c is mode a+r.
