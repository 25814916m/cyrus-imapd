This is the Carnegie Mellon University Cyrus IMAP Server.

****
NOTE
****

This distribution is approximately beta quality software; Carnegie
Mellon University will be deploying it on our production servers
extremely soon.  The 2.0 release contains many new features over 1.6.

No further development work will progress on 1.6 so we encourage you
to work with the Cyrus 2.0 code wherever possible.  Version 1.6 can be
found here:
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-imapd-1.6.24.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/BETA/cyrus-imapd-1.6.25.tar.gz

If you continue to install this PLEASE be sure to read the
documentation as a number of items have changed.  Please also refer
to doc/bugs.html for any outstanding bugs with the current release.
