.SH NAME
imtest \- test interactive IMAP program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B imtest
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I imtest
is a utility that allows you to authenticate to a IMAP or IMSP server
and interactively issue commands to it. Once authenticated you may
issue any IMAP or IMSP command by simply typing it in. It is capable
of multiple SASL authentication mechanisms and handles encryption
layers transparently. This utility is often used for testing the
operation of a imsp or imap server. Also those developing IMAP clients
find it useful.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.I -p <port>
Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to "imap" as defined in
/etc/services. 

.I -m <mechanism>
Force imtest to use <mechanism> for authentication. If not specified
the strongest authentication mechanism supported by the server is
chosen.

.I -u <user>
Username to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.

.I -a <user>
Authname to use for authentication; defaults to the current user.

.I -l <num>
Maximum protection layer to use (0=none; 1=integrity; etc). For
example if you are using the KERBEROS_V4 authentication mechanism
specifing 0 will force imtest to not use any layer and specifying 1
will force it to use the integrity layer. By default the maximum
supported protection layer will be used.

.I -r realm
Specify the realm to use. Certain authentication mechanisms
(e.g. DIGEST-MD5) may require one to specify the realm

.I -f <file>
Pipe file into connection after authentication

.I -v
Verbose. Print out more information than usual

.I -z
Timing test.

.TP
