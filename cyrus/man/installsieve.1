.SH NAME
installsieve \- user utility for managing sieve scripts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B installsieve
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I installsieve
is a utility that allows users to manage their sieve scripts kept on the server.


.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.I -v <name>
View script with the given name. The script if retrieved sucessfully is output to standard output

.I -l
List all of the scripts currently on the server. If one of the scripts is active a arrow is printed indicating that it is the active script.

.I -p <port>
Port to connect to. If left off this defaults to "sieve" as defined in /etc/services. This takes numerical or named arguements

.I -i <file>
Install a file onto the server. If a script with the same name already exists on the server it is overwritten. Upon sucessfully putting the script on the server the script is set active. If <file> has the extension .script it is chopped when put on the server since sieve names may not contain a '.'

.I -a <name>
Set <name> as the active script. The list of available names can be obtained from the '-l' option.

.I -d <name>
Delete the sieve script on the server with <name>

.I -m <mechanism>
Force installsieve to use <mechanism> for authentication. If not specified the strongest authentication mechanism is chosen.

.I -g <name>
Get the sieve script with <name> and save it to disk with a ".script" extension. Note if a file with that name already exists it is overwritten

.I -u <user>
Userid/Authname to use for authentication.
