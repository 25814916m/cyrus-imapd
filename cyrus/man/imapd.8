.SH NAME
imapd \- IMAP server process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B imapd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Imapd
is an IMAP4 server.
It accepts commands on its standard input and responds on its standard output.
It is normally invoked by
.IR inetd (8)
with those descriptors attached to a remote client connection.
.PP
.I Imapd
reads its configuration options out of the
.IR imapd.conf (5)
file.
.PP
If the file
msg/shutdown
is created under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I imapd
will shut down the connection, sending the first line contained in the
file to the client as the reason.
.PP
If the directory
.RI log/ user
exists under the directory specified in the
.I configdirectory
configuration option, then
.I imapd
will create protocol telemetry logs for sessions authenticating as
.IR user .
The telemetry logs will be stored in the 
.RI log/ user
directory with a filename of the
.I imapd
process-id.
