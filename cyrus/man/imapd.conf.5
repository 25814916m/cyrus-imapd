.PP
where \fIoption\fR is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fR is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.

For boolean options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'', and ``1'' turn the
option on, the values ``no'', ``off'', ``f'', and ``0'' turn the option off.

.IP "\fBsrvtab: /etc/srvtab\fR" 5
The pathname of \fIsrvtab\fR file containing the server's private 
key.  This option is only included when the server is compiled with
Kerberos authentication.

The list of remote realms whose users may log in using 
cross-realm authentications.  Seperate each realm name
by a space.  This value is only included when the servier is
