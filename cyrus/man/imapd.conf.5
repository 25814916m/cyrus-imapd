.SH NAME
imapd.conf \- IMAP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR 
is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
local parameters for IMAP. 
.PP
Each line of the \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file has the form
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR
.PP
where \fIoption\fR is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fR is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.PP
For boolean options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'', and ``1'' turn the
option on, the values ``no'', ``off'', ``f'', and ``0'' turn the option off.
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
.PP
The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file, and show each option's default value.
Some options have no default value, these are listed with
``<no default>''.  Some options default to the empty string, these
are listed with ``<none>''.
.IP "\fBconfigdirectory:\fR <no default>" 5
The pathname of the IMAP configuration directory.  This field is required.
.IP "\fBdefaultpartition:\fR default" 5
The partition name used by default for new mailboxes.
.IP "\fBpartition-\fIname\fB:\fR <no default>" 5
The pathname of the partition \fIname\fR.  At least one field, for the
partition named in the \fBdefaultpartition\fR option, is required.
For example, if the value of the \fBdefaultpartion\fR option is
\fBdefault\fR, then the \fBpartition-default\fR field is required.
.IP "\fBumask:\fR 077" 5
The umask value used by various Cyrus IMAP programs.
.IP "\fBallowanonymouslogin:\fR no" 5
Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.
.IP "\fBquotawarn:\fR 90" 5
The percent of quota utilization over which the server generates
warnings.
.IP "\fBtimeout:\fR 30" 5
The length of the IMAP server's inactivity autologout timer,
in minutes.  The minimum value is 30, the default.
.IP "\fBpoptimeout:\fR 10" 5
Set the length of the POP server's inactivity autologout timer,
in minutes.  The minimum value is 10, the default.
.IP "\fBadmins:\fR <none>" 5
The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
with a space. We recommend that administrator userids be separate from
standard userids.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
separate "admin" instances.
.IP "\fBimspservers:\fR <none>" 5
The list of the host names of the mail domain's IMSP servers.
Separate each host name with a space.  The Kerberos identities of
these servers may login as any user in order to perform commands by
proxy.
.IP "\fBdefaultacl:\fR anyone lrs" 5
The Access Control List (ACL) placed on a newly-created (non-user) 
mailbox that does not have a parent mailbox.
.IP "\fBnewsprefix:\fR <none>" 5
Prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make the corresponding
IMAP mailbox names.
.IP "\fBautocreatequota:\fR 0" 5
If nonzero, normal users may create their own IMAP accounts by
creating the mailbox INBOX.  The user's quota is set to the value if
it is positive, otherwise the user has unlimited quota.
.IP "\fBlogtimestamps:\fR no" 5
Include notations in the protocol telemetry logs indicating the number of
seconds since the last command or response.
.IP "\fBsrvtab:\fR /etc/srvtab" 5
The pathname of \fIsrvtab\fR file containing the server's private 
key.  This option is only used when the server is compiled with
Kerberos authentication.
.IP "\fBloginrealms:\fR <none>" 5
The list of remote realms whose users may log in using 
cross-realm authentications.  Seperate each realm name
by a space.  This option is only used when the server is
compiled with Kerberos authentication.
.IP "\fBloginuseacl:\fR no" 5
If enabled, any authentication identity which has \fBa\fR rights on a
user's INBOX may log in as that user.  This option is only used when
the server is compiled with Kerberos authentication.
