.SH NAME
fud \- provide information about user mailboxes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fud
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I FUD
is a long lived datagram daemon started from inetd that provides information about when a user last
read their mail, when mail last arrived in a user's mailbox, and how
many messages are recent for that user.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/imapd.conf
.SH BUGS
Though not really a bug, 
.B FUD
will silently ignore any requests that it does not consider valid.
.PP
.B FUD
is an experimental interface meant to provide information to build a
finger-like service around.  Eventually it should be superceded by LDAP
or ACAP (using the mailbox dataset).
