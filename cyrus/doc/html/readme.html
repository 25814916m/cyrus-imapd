      <H1>                Cyrus IMAP Server Release Information</H1>
      
      IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-track
      protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc).  The Cyrus
      IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
      is generally intended to be run on "sealed" servers, where normal
      users are not permitted to log in.  The mailbox database is stored in
      parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system.
      All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.
      
      <P>
	The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages
	in efficiency, scalability, and administratability.  Multiple
	concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted.
	The server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage
	quotas on mailbox hierarchies.
	
      <P>
	This system should be expected to have the same order-of-magnitude
	<A HREF="install.html">installation</A> complexity as a netnews
	system.  Maintenance should have similar complexity, except
	administrators will have to deal with <A
	HREF="cyradm.1.html">creation and deletion of users</A> and will
	have the option of managing quotas and access control lists.
	  
      <P> This server has been successfully installed on a number of Unix
	systems.  The following are notes on particular Unix variants:
	
      <ul>
	
	<LI> HP-UX 9.0.4:  Comments from testers:
	  <P> The C that ships with HP-UX is totally unsuited for use with unix
	    packages.  Either the HP-UX ANSI C developers kit must be
	    purchased separately from HP or GNU's gcc compiler (which can
	    bootstrap itself from the basic HP C) must be built on the target
	    system.
	  <P> The author further notes that the memory mapping support in HP-UX
	    is lacking on 9.0 versions of HP-UX and 10.20 as well; it appears
	    this is related to the hardware's use of inverse page tables. It
	    is recommended that large-scale sites consider using some other
	    platform for IMAP servers.
	    
      </ul>

    <p>
      The following are notes on specific Unix features:
    <ul>
      <li> On any system with shadow passwords (including Solaris 2.5 with
	Unix authentication), read the SASL documentation carefully to
	make sure it is configured correctly.
    </ul>
    

<p>Please refer to <a href="feedback.html">Sending Feedback</a> if you
would like to submit a bug, feature request or (best of all) patch.

<p>There is a mailing list. See the <a
	    href="mailing-list.html">mailing list</a> for details.
    
    <P>
      The Cyrus server supports the IMAP4rev1 protocol described in RFC
      2060, with the exception that it does not currently support the
      hierarchical behavior of the RENAME command.  IMAP4rev1 has been
      approved as a proposed standard.
    <P>
      Character sets supported for searching are: us-ascii, iso-8859-1,
      iso-8859-2, iso-8859-3, iso-8859-4, iso-8859-5, iso-8859-6,
      iso-8859-7, iso-8859-8, iso-8859-9, koi8-r, and iso-2022-jp.  The
      character mapping tables most likely contain errors.
      
    <P>
      The server server supports any authentication mechanism
	  available from the SASL library. Currently, support
	  includes: KERBEROS_V4, GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5.  

    <P>
      The mailbox namespace is like that for netnews--hierarchical names
      separated by the "<tt>.</tt>" character.  Mailboxes without a parent may only
      be created by an administrator.  Mailboxes with a parent may be
      created as the ACL (Access Control List) on the parent mailbox
      permits.
      
    <P>
      Users' personal mailboxes are under the "<tt>user</tt>" hierarchy.
      The names of the personal mailboxes for user "<tt>bovik</tt>" all
      start with the prefix "<tt>user.bovik.</tt>".  The mailbox
      "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" is special in that it is presented to user
      "<tt>bovik</tt>" as if it were named "<tt>INBOX</tt>".  Creating
      the mailbox "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" is equivalent to creating an
      account for user "<tt>bovik</tt>"--it permits "<tt>bovik</tt>" to
      receive mail, create personal mailboxes, and subscribe to
      mailboxes.  Deleting the mailbox "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" has the
	special-case side-effect of deleting all mailboxes starting with
	"<tt>user.bovik.</tt>" and of deleting the subscriptions for
	"<tt>bovik</tt>."

      <p>
	If you want to install the server, be sure to read the
	<a href="install.html">install</a> instructions along with the <a
	  href="overview.html">server overview</a>.
