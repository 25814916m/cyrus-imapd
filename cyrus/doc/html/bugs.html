<h1>                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server</h1>

<ul>
<li>The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required by
the IMAP4rev1 specification.  The CAPABILITY command now returns
X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise this bug.
We plan to have this fixed in the next release.

<li>If a client tries to FETCH or UID FETCH a BODY[] attribute from a
netnews-format mailbox, the server truncates the message by one character
for each line in the message (due to LF/CRLF conversion) We plan to have
this fixed in the next release.

<li>Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part of
groups may be granted access to mailboes if ptclient has failed.  We plan
to have this fixed in the next release.

<li>LIST NIL *.% causes the current imapd process to hang.  We plan to have
this fixed in the next release.

<li>We are aware that cyrus.seen files are occasionally corrupted, but we
are not sure why this is happening.  It seems to happen most with mailboxes
with a large number of users.  We hope to have this fixed in a future
release.

<li> UID FETCH of a range of nonexistant UIDs causes the server to drop
connection.

</ul>

<p>
Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.  Be sure to include
(at least) system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure,
along with a detailed report.  Additional information is welcome, and
naturally, patches are deeply appreciated.
