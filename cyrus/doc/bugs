                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server

      * The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required
        by the IMAP4rev1 specification. The CAPABILITY command now returns
        X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise
        this bug. We plan to have this fixed in the next release. 
      * If a client tries to FETCH or UID FETCH a BODY[] attribute from a
        netnews-format mailbox, the server truncates the message by one
        character for each line in the message (due to LF/CRLF conversion)
        We plan to have this fixed in the next release. 
      * Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part
        of groups may be granted access to mailboes if ptclient has failed.
        We plan to have this fixed in the next release. 
      * LIST NIL *.% causes the current imapd process to hang. We plan to
        have this fixed in the next release. 
      * We are aware that cyrus.seen files are occasionally corrupted, but
        we are not sure why this is happening. It seems to happen most with
        mailboxes with a large number of users. We hope to have this fixed
        in a future release. 

    Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu. Be sure to include (at
    least) system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure,
    along with a detailed report. Additional information is welcome, and
    naturally, patches are deeply appreciated.
