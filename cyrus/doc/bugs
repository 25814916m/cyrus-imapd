                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server

      * The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required
        by the IMAP4rev1 specification. The CAPABILITY command now returns
        X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise
        this bug. We plan to have this fixed in the next release. 
      * Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part
        of groups may be granted access to mailboes if ptclient has died.
        We plan to have this fixed in the next release. 
      * COPY of a nonexistant sequence of messages results in OK, but
        should result in NO. 
      * 8-bit set characters are coerced to 'X', but not before the
        notify_zephyr code (if used) has had a chance to send them out. 
      * imtest cheats and sends a non-synchronizing literal if you try to
        LOGIN (cleartext passwords). 
      * In some failures of the krbck program, the error messages printed
        out bear no resemblance to what actually went wrong. 
      * Deliver does not handle messages containing NUL properly due to
        stdio problems (the characters between the NUL and the LF will be
        lost.) 

    Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu. Be sure to include (at
    least) system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure,
    along with a detailed report. Additional information is welcome, and
    naturally, patches are deeply appreciated. 

    If you submit a patch, please send unified diffs (-u) if your diff
    program supports them, or context diffs (-c) if it doesn't.
