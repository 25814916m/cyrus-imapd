                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server

imapd and core utilities

      * Multiple APPENDs don't always correctly return the EXISTS response.
        (can't reproduce?) 
      * Particularly large quotas can wrap around. 
      * The RENAME command is not atomic. 
      * RENAMEing INBOX doesn't work correctly. (important!) 
      * append.c: doesn't set the \Seen flag if the client requests it. 
      * MULTIAPPEND: does it do the right thing with an aborted APPEND
        (literal length {0})? 
      * reconstruct doesn't deal with the mailboxes.db file. 
      * deliver (wrapper) should fill in a more useful Return-Path when
        none is given. (not important)
