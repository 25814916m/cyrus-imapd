 Installing and Configuring the Cyrus IMAP Server

    The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet
    standards-track protocol for accessing messages (mail, news, etc). The
    IMAP server stores and provides access to messages. 

    A list of answers to common installation problems is maintained in
    http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/imapd/install-FAQ.html. It is very out of
    date and will eventually be updated. The file doc/html/questions.html
    contains a list of questions we'd like to answer but haven't gotten to
    yet. 

    Please refer to Sending Feedback if you would like to submit a bug,
    feature request or patch. 

    For detailed changes, refer to the file doc/changes in the
    distribution.
