<h1>Operating System Notes
</h1>
<body>

<h2>All</h2>

<li> Shadow passwords
<br>On any system with shadow passwords (including Solaris 2.5 with
Unix authentication), read the SASL documentation carefully to make
sure it is configured correctly.

<h2>HP-UX</h2>

<li> The memory mapping support (<tt>mmap(2)</tt>) in HP-UX does not
have the right semantics for the Cyrus IMAP server under the 9.0 and
10.0 release of the operating system. It appears this is related to
the hardware's use of inverse page tables. It is recommended that
large-scale sites consider using some other platform.

<p><LI> HP-UX 9.0.4: Comments from testers

<br> The C that ships with HP-UX is totally unsuited for use with unix
packages.  Either the HP-UX ANSI C developers kit must be purchased
separately from HP or GNU's gcc compiler (which can bootstrap itself
from the basic HP C) must be built on the target system.


<h2>Linux</h2>
<li> synchronous fs updates.
<br>By turning on synchronous updates for ext2fs, all updates (instead of
just meta-data) become synchronous. This is good for reliability. Bad
for performance.

<p> The big problem used to be with the <tt>mailboxes</tt> file. The
2.0 release and later addressed this problem by changing the flat file
to a Berkerley DB database.

<p>Note this is for ext2fs. If you are using a newer filesystem (such
as reiserfs or xfs) the performance hit may not be as bad or you may
not need to do this. We haven't really looked at other filesystems for
linux yet.
