      <H1>                Cyrus IMAP Server Release Information</H1>
      

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-track
protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc).  The Cyrus
IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
is generally intended to be run on "sealed" servers, where normal
users are not permitted to log in.  The mailbox database is stored in
parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system.
All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.
      
<P> The private mailbox database design gives the server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability.
Multiple concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are
permitted.  The server supports access control lists on mailboxes and
storage quotas on mailbox hierarchies.

<h2>Features</h2>

<P> The Cyrus server supports the IMAP4rev1 protocol described in RFC
2060, with the exception that it does not currently support the
hierarchical behavior of the RENAME command.  IMAP4rev1 has been
approved as a proposed standard.

<P> Character sets supported for searching are: us-ascii, iso-8859-1,
iso-8859-2, iso-8859-3, iso-8859-4, iso-8859-5, iso-8859-6,
iso-8859-7, iso-8859-8, iso-8859-9, koi8-r, and iso-2022-jp.  The
character mapping tables most likely contain errors.
      
<P> The server supports any authentication mechanism available from
the SASL library. Currently, support includes: KERBEROS_V4, GSSAPI,
CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and STARTLS.

<p> The server supports imaps/pops (IMAP/POP encrypted using SSL).

<p> The server makes an attempt to do single instance store where 
possible when an email message is addressed to multiple recipients.

<p>We current support the following IMAP capabilities:
<tt>
IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 ACL QUOTA LITERAL+ NAMESPACE UIDPLUS NO_ATOMIC_RENAME
UNSELECT MULTIAPPEND</tt>.

<p> The server supports SIEVE for server side email filtering.

<h2>Upgrade Caveats</h2>

This section reserved for WARNING WARNING WARNING comments.

<h2>Installation Overview</h2>
	
<P> This system should be expected to have the same order-of-magnitude
installation complexity as a netnews system.  Maintenance should have
similar complexity, except administrators will have to deal with <A
HREF="cyradm.1.html">creation and deletion of users</A> and will have
the option of managing quotas and access control lists.

<p>This package is distributed as a source only release. It is
expected that you can compile and configure software. Installation
instructions are in the <a
href="install.html">install.html</a>. Please be sure to read
this document.

<p>A detailed overview of the server is available in <a
href="overview.html">overview.html</a>.

<P> This server has been successfully installed on a number of Unix
systems.  We run the software under SPARC Solaris 2.6.  Please refer
to <a href="os.html">os.html</a> for operating system specific issues. 


<h2>Server Notes</h2>

<P> The mailbox namespace is like that for netnews--hierarchical names
separated by the "<tt>.</tt>" character.  Mailboxes without a parent
may only be created by an administrator.  Mailboxes with a parent may
be created as the ACL (Access Control List) on the parent mailbox
permits.
      
<P> Users' personal mailboxes are under the "<tt>user</tt>" hierarchy.
The names of the personal mailboxes for user "<tt>bovik</tt>" all
start with the prefix "<tt>user.bovik.</tt>".  The mailbox
"<tt>user.bovik</tt>" is special in that it is presented to user
"<tt>bovik</tt>" as if it were named "<tt>INBOX</tt>".  Creating the
mailbox "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" is equivalent to creating an account for
user "<tt>bovik</tt>"--it permits "<tt>bovik</tt>" to receive mail,
create personal mailboxes, and subscribe to mailboxes.  Deleting the
mailbox "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" has the special-case side-effect of
deleting all mailboxes starting with "<tt>user.bovik.</tt>" and of
deleting the subscriptions for "<tt>bovik</tt>."

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you want to install the server, be sure to read the installation
instructions in <a
href="install.html">install.html"</a>. More details about the
server implementation is in the <a href="overview.html">server
overview</a> document.
