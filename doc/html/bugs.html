<h1>                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server</h1>

<ul>
<li>The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required by
the IMAP4rev1 specification.  The CAPABILITY command now returns
X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise this bug.
We plan to have this fixed in the next release.

<li>Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part of
groups may be granted access to mailboes if ptclient has died.  We plan
to have this fixed in the next release.

<li>We are aware that cyrus.seen files are occasionally corrupted, but we
are not sure why this is happening.  It seems to happen most with mailboxes
with a large number of users.  We hope to have this fixed in a future
release.

<li> UID FETCH of a range of nonexistant UIDs causes the server to drop
connection.

<li> imtest cheats and sends a non-synchronizing literal if you try to
LOGIN (cleartext passwords).

<li> In some failures of the krbck program, the error messages printed out
bear no resemblance to what actually went wrong.

</ul>

<p>
Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.  Be sure to include
(at least) system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure,
along with a detailed report.  Additional information is welcome, and
naturally, patches are deeply appreciated.

<p>
If you submit a patch, please send context diffs or unified diffs, not the
	default unreadable diff.
