<h1>                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server</h1>

<ul>
<li>The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required by
the IMAP4rev1 specification.  The CAPABILITY command now returns
X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise this bug.
We plan to have this fixed in the next release.

<li>Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part of
groups may be granted access to mailboes if ptclient has died.  We plan
to have this fixed in the next release.

<li> COPY of a nonexistant sequence of messages results in OK, but should
result in NO.

<li> 8-bit set characters are coerced to 'X', but not before the notify_zephyr 
code (if used) has had a chance to send them out.

<li> imtest cheats and sends a non-synchronizing literal if you try to
LOGIN (cleartext passwords).

<li> In some failures of the krbck program, the error messages printed out
bear no resemblance to what actually went wrong.

<li> Deliver does not handle messages containing NUL properly due to stdio
problems (the characters between the NUL and the LF will be
lost.)

</ul>

<p>
Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.  Be sure to include
(at least) system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure,
along with a detailed report.  Additional information is welcome, and
naturally, patches are deeply appreciated.

<p>
If you submit a patch, please send unified diffs (-u) if your diff program
supports them, or context diffs (-c) if it doesn't.
