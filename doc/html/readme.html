<H1>                Cyrus IMAP Server Release Information</H1>

IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an Internet standards-track
protocol for accessing messages (mail, bboards, news, etc).  The Cyrus
IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
is generally intended to be run on "sealed" servers, where normal
users are not permitted to log in.  The mailbox database is stored in
parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system.
All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

<P>
The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages
in efficiency, scalability, and administratability.  Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted.
The server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage
quotas on mailbox hierarchies.

<P>
This system should be expected to have the same order-of-magnitude
<A HREF="install.html">installation </A>complexity as a netnews system.  
Maintenance should have
similar complexity, except administrators will have to deal with
<A HREF="cyradm.1.html">creation and deletion of users</A> and will 
have the option of managing quotas and access control lists.

<P> This server has been successfully installed on the following systems

<ul>

<LI> SunOS 4.1.3, gcc &amp; cc, Kerberos

<LI> SunOS 5.4 (Solaris), gcc &amp; cc, passwd file

<LI> Ultrix 4.2 (Decstation), gcc &amp; cc, Kerberos

<LI> HPUX 9.05, gcc, Kerberos.  Some problems compiling with cc.

<LI> RS/6000 AIX 3.2.5, xlc, Kerberos

<LI> NeXTStep 3.2, gcc, Kerberos

</ul>

Send problems/questions/suggestions to
"<TT>cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu</TT>".

<P>
The "<tt>info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu</tt>" mailing list exists for the 
discussion of this server and other Cyrus software.  Send mail 
to "<TT>info-cyrus-request@andrew.cmu.edu</TT>" to subscribe.

<P>
The Cyrus server supports the IMAP4 protocol described in
<a href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/rfc/rfc1730.html">RFC 1730</a>,
which is currently a Proposed Standard.

<P>
Character sets supported for searching are: us-ascii, iso-8859-1,
iso-8859-2, iso-8859-3, iso-8859-4, iso-8859-5, iso-8859-6,
iso-8859-7, iso-8859-8, iso-8859-9, koi8-r, and iso-2022-jp.  The
character mapping tables most likely contain errors.

<P>
The server may be compiled to support the KERBEROS_V4 authentication
mechanism described in
<a href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/cyrus/rfc/rfc1731.html">RFC 1731</a>.
The POP3 server can support MIT's KPOP protocol.

<P>
The mailbox namespace is like that for netnews--hierarchical names
separated by the "<tt>.</tt>" character.  Mailboxes without a parent may only
be created by an administrator.  Mailboxes with a parent may be
created as the ACL (Access Control List) on the parent mailbox
permits.

<P>
Users' personal mailboxes are under the "<tt>user</tt>" hierarchy.  The names
of the personal mailboxes for user "<tt>bovik</tt>" all start with the prefix
"<tt>user.bovik.</tt>".  The mailbox "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" is special in that it is
presented to user "<tt>bovik</tt>" as if it were named "<tt>INBOX</tt>".  Creating the
mailbox "<tt>user.bovik</tt>" is equivalent to creating an account for user
"<tt>bovik</tt>"--it permits "<tt>bovik</tt>" to receive mail, create personal
mailboxes, and subscribe to mailboxes.  Deleting the mailbox
"<tt>user.bovik</tt>" has the special-case side-effect of deleting all
mailboxes starting with "<tt>user.bovik.</tt>" and of deleting the
subscriptions for "<tt>bovik</tt>."
