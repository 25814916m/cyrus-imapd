Configuring the IMAP Server

    This section describes the shell scripts to run and the configuration
    files to modify once "configure" and "make" have run. 

     1. Create a user and group for the Cyrus subsystem. The examples in
        this document assume a user of "cyrus" and a group of "mail",
        though any user and group name can be used. If a user other than
        "cyrus" is to be used, it must have been previously specified in
        the "--with-cyrus-user=" option to "configure". If a group other
        than "mail" is to be used, it must have been previously specified
        in the "--with-cyrus-group=" option to "configure". 

     2. After you've logged in as "root", install the cyrus software. 

           make install

        Be sure that the server programs ended up in the directory
        specified by "--with-cyrus-prefix" (by default, "/usr/cyrus/bin"). 

     3. The Cyrus IMAP server uses the 4.3BSD syslog that separates
        messages into both levels and categories. Invoke "man syslog" to
        see if "openlog()" takes three arguments. If it does not, replace
        the system "syslogd" and "syslog.conf" with the files provided in
        the "syslog" directory. 

           mv syslogd /etc/syslogd
           mv syslog.conf /etc/syslog.conf

        If you do not copy the "syslog/syslog.conf" file to the "/etc"
        directory, be sure to add support for "local6.debug". The file
        should include a line like: 

           local6.debug  /var/log/imapd.log

        You probably also want to log SASL messages with a line like: 

           auth.debug /var/log/auth.log

        After installation and testing, you probably want to change the
        ".debug" component to something a little less verbose. Create the
        log files: 

           touch /var/log/imapd.log /var/log/auth.log

     4. Create the file "/etc/imapd.conf". Here is a sample "imapd.conf"
        with a minimal number of values defined: 

           configdirectory: /var/imap
           partition-default: /var/spool/imap
           admins: curtj abell
           sasl_pwcheck_method: passwd

        For a description of all the fields in this file, see the
        imapd.conf(5) man page. (Note that this file also exports values to
        libsasl, the most important of them the pwcheck_method. In this
        example, users are authenticated via the getpwnam() call.) 

        READ THE imapd.conf(5) MAN PAGE. There are options in there that
        you will want to know about and default behavior that you may not
        like. 

        Note that everyday users should not be administrators. Admins have
        powers not granted to regular users and while the server allows
        them to receive mail, some problems will occur if admins are used
        as regular users. You also should not read mail as an
        administrator. You should have separate accounts for reading mail
        and administrating. 

     5. Decide how users are going to be authenticated. The easiest method
        for authenticating users is to use the libsasl authentication
        database and create users using the "saslpasswd" utility. Set
        "sasl_pwcheck_method: sasldb". Make sure Cyrus can read
        "/etc/sasldb": 

           chown cyrus /etc/sasldb*

        If you want to authenticate users from "/etc/shadow", things are
        considerably more complicated, since the cyrus user cannot read the
        shadow password file. It is suggested that you configure libsasl
        with pwcheck support, and set "sasl_pwcheck_method: pwcheck". The
        SASL library will then make calls to an external utility running as
        root to authenticate users. 

        If you are using Kerberos, see the section below on configuring
        Kerberos. 

     6. Create the configuration directory specified by the
        "configdirectory" option in "imapd.conf." The configuration
        directory is similar in concept to the "/usr/lib/news" directory.
        It stores information about the IMAP server as a whole. 

        This document uses the configuration directory "/var/imap" in its
        examples. This directory should be owned by the cyrus user and
        group and should not permit access to other users. 

           cd /var
           mkdir imap
           chown cyrus imap
           chgrp mail imap
           chmod 750 imap

     7. Create the default partition directories specified in the
        "/etc/imapd.conf" file. 

        This document uses a default partition directory of
        "/var/spool/imap" in the following example: 

           cd /var/spool
           mkdir imap
           chown cyrus imap
           chgrp mail imap
           chmod 750 imap

        The partition directory is similar in concept to /var/spool/news.
        It is where the mailboxes are stored. Unlike most netnews systems,
        Cyrus allows you to have more than one partition. Do not use the
        string "news" as a partition name, as it is reserved for netnews. 
     8. If you wish to use Sieve, and you didn't configure deliver to look
        in home directories (see the imapd.conf man page), create the Sieve
        directory: 

           cd /usr
           mkdir sieve
           chown cyrus sieve
           chgrp mail sieve
           chmod 750 sieve

     9. Change to the Cyrus user and use the tool "tools/mkimap" to create
        the rest of the directories (subdirectories of the directories you
        just created). 

           su cyrus
           tools/mkimap
           exit


        If Perl is not available, it should be easy (but time consuming) to
        create these directories by hand. 

    10. LINUX SYSTEMS ONLY: Set the user, quota, and partition directories
        to update synchronously. Failure to do this may lead to data
        corruption and/or loss of mail after a system crash. Unfortunately,
        doing so may result in a serious performance hit. Note this is for
        ext2fs. If you are using a newer filesystem, either the performance
        hit may not be as bad or you may not need to do this. 

           cd /var/imap
           chattr +S user quota user/* quota/*
           chattr +S /var/spool/imap /var/spool/imap/*

        Also set the queue directory of the mail daemon to update
        synchronously. The following example is for sendmail: 

           chattr +S /var/spool/mqueue

    11. To enable STARTTLS support, see how to configure OpenSSL below. 

    12. Add the following lines to the "/etc/services" file if they aren't
        already there. 

           pop3      110/tcp
           imap      143/tcp
           imsp      406/tcp
           acap      674/tcp
           imaps     993/tcp
           pop3s     995/tcp
           kpop      1109/tcp
           sieve     2000/tcp
           lmtp      2003/tcp
           fud       4201/udp

Configuring the Master Process

     1. Choose a configuration from the master/conf directory: 

        small.conf
                bare-bones server supporting IMAP and POP 
        normal.conf
                server supporting IMAP, POP, the SSL wrapped versions, and
                the Sieve script management protocol 
        prefork.conf
                The same configuration as above, but with some preforked
                processes for faster processing. 
        cmu.confOur configuration 

        To use normal.conf, do: 

           cp master/conf/normal.conf /etc/cyrus.conf

        Optionally, you can edit /etc/cyrus.conf to disable or enabling
        certain services, or to tune the number of preforked copies. Be
        sure not to remove the entries that are labeled required. 

     2. Arrange to start "/usr/cyrus/bin/master" as root when the system
        starts. It will bind some ports and then give up it's root
        privileges. Until your system reboots, you can start the master
        process by hand:
