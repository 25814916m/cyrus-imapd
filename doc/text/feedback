Sending Feedback on the Cyrus IMAP Server

    Feedback on and fixes for the software or on the document may be sent
    to cyrus-bugs+@andrew.cmu.edu. Unfortunately, we can not guarantee a
    response but we'll try the best we can. As usual, a high quality and
    complete message helps us tremendously. 

    If you submit a patch, please send unified diffs (-u) if your diff
    program supports them, or context diffs (-c) if it doesn't. Plain diffs
    are very difficult to evaluate. GNU diff can do this. 

    When reporting problems, be sure to include the relevant information.
    For example, you must include: 

      * the version of imapd 
      * the version of libsasl 
      * your system type (uname -a often provides the right information. 

    You may also want to include: 

      * the options you passed to ./configure 
      * the errors from make (if any) 
      * the config.status file generated by configure 

    The info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu mailing list exists for the discussion of
    this server and other Cyrus software; more information is available in
    the mailing-list document.
