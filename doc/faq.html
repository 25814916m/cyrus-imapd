<li>Using PAM - Under Linux when using PAM and shadow passwords,
/etc/shadow needs to be readable by the Cyrus user. 

<li>Using NFS - We don't recommend it. If you want to do it, it may 
possibly work but you may also lose your email. You can look at the
mailing list archives for more information. 

<li>Virtual hosting - We don't support it and don't plan to support
it.  If you want it, you'll need to do it yourself or use a commercial
product. Check the list archives for more information.
