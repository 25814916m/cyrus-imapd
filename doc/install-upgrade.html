<h3>Upgrading from 2.0.6</h3>

nothing known.

<h3>Upgrading from a previous 2.0 version to 2.0.6</h3>

<b>Warning:</b> You do not need to follow these instructions if you're
upgrading from version 1.6.

<ul>
<li>You can now pick whether to use Berkeley db to store seen state,
the subscription files, and the mailboxes file or a flat text file, at
compile time only.  (Look in <tt>imap/seen_db.c</tt> and
<tt>imap/mboxlist.h</tt>.)

<li>The format of the mailboxes file and seen state has changed.  It is
not possible to preserve seen state, but upgrade the mailboxes file as
follows:
<ol>
<li> Run <tt>ctl_mboxlist -d &gt; mboxlist.temp</tt> to dump existing
mailboxes.

<li> Remove old database files: <tt>rm mailboxes.db db/*
user/*/*.seen</tt>

<li>With the new version of ctl_mboxlist, run <tt>ctl_mboxlist -u &lt;
mboxlist.temp</tt>.
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Upgrading from 1.6.22 or 1.6.24</h3>

<b>Warning:</b> Cyrus imapd 2.0 will automatically convert on-disk
file formats as the server is used.  <b>It is not possible to run 1.6
after 2.0 has been used on a mail spool without reconstructing every
mailbox.</b>

<ul>
<li>Convert mailboxes file to Berkeley DB:
<pre>
<kbd>   su cyrus
   cd /var/imap
   ctl_mboxlist -u &lt; mailboxes
   ctl_mboxlist -c
</kbd></pre>

Please keep a backup of your mailboxes file.  You can dump an
old-style mailboxes file by using <tt>ctl_mboxlist -d</tt>.

<li>cyrus.seen conversion. The cyrus.seen file will be automatically
upgraded as users read mail.  After some time, you might want to
delete the cyrus.seen file in each mailbox; it is superceded by the
user/joe.seen file.

<li>cyrus.index conversion.  The cyrus.index file will be
automatically upgraded the first time each mailbox is SELECTed.

<li>Netnews conversion. The netnews programs are no longer built. If
you are using netnews, you will need to apply the diff in the
<tt>netnews/</tt> directory to INN or see if INN is now distributing
those changes.  You will also want to run <tt>remotepurge</tt> on a
regular basis to purge old netnews posts.

<li>remove inetd.conf entries. The <tt>imap</tt> and <tt>popd3d</tt>
lines need to be removed from <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> and inetd needs
to be restarted.

<li>sendmail configuration. You need to use a new cyrus mc file. See
<a href="cyrusv2.mc"><tt>doc/cyrusv2.mc</tt></a> for a sample mc
file. This requires Sendmail 8.10 or newer.

<li>You'll probably need to create some extra directories.
<pre>
<kbd>   mkdir /var/imap/db
   mkdir /var/imap/socket
   chown cyrus /var/imap/db /var/imap/socket
</kbd></pre>

</ul>


<h3>Upgrading from 1.6.13</h3>
<ul>
<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.13 or earlier:
if you use Sieve, you should run the "<tt>tools/upgradesieve</tt>"
script, as the format of the "<tt>/usr/sieve</tt>" directory has
changed slightly.

<p>timsieved, included in this release, will handle maintenance of Sieve
scripts.

<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.10 or earlier:
if you export news via the IMAP server, you'll have to change your
"<tt>newsfeeds</tt>" file to contain
<pre>collectnews!:*:Tf,WR:collectnews</pre>  The format of the
input to collectnews has changed.

<p>Duplicate delivery suppression is now required for Sieve.

<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.1 or earlier
(including 1.5.x!): the quota and user directories are now hashed by
the first character of the username.  This is to reduce the number of
entries in any given directory. It doesn't do a great job (and in some
cases it will do a really poor job) but as a quick hack it shouldn't
make things worse.  Optionally, the data partitions can also be hashed
by enabling the "hashimapspool" option.

<p>You must hash your directories using the "<tt>dohash</tt>" script
in the tools subdirectory.  (If you want to hash your mail spool, be
sure to set "hashimapspool" before running "<tt>dohash</tt>".)  This
must be run as the Cyrus user. Be sure to stop mail service while
converting. Doing this in single user mode is probably the safest.

</ul>

<h3>Upgrading from 1.5</h3>
<ul>
<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.5 or earlier:
libsasl is now required.  Configuring SASL to work may be a chore,
especially if you use shadow passwords.

<li> An ANSI C compiler is now required.  gcc should work fine and can
be acquired from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html</a>.

<li> Make sure to read the upgrading instructions under 1.6 above.

<li> Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires deleting the delivered
database.  Remove the file delivered.db in the configdirectory and make a
directory called "deliverdb" in the configdirectory.  This may cause some
duplicates to get through.

<li> Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires removing the PTS cache
database (if the AFS PTS group support is used, which is not the
default).  The PTS cache is in /var/ptclient/ptscache.db, and you
should remove it. This is because the format for the PTS cache for
IMSP has changed.  If you use AFS ACLs, IMSPd, and IMAPd on the same
machine, make sure you have version 1.5a5 of the IMSP server for this
version of the IMAP server.  (If you don't have IMSP, or AFS, don't
worry about it.)

</ul>
