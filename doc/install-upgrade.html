<h1>Upgrading From Previous Versions
</h1>

<body>
<h3>Upgrading from 1.6</h3>
<ul>
<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.13 or earlier:
if you use Sieve, you should run the "<tt>tools/upgradesieve</tt>"
script, as the format of the "<tt>/usr/sieve</tt>" directory has
changed slightly.

timsieved, included in this release, will handle maintenance of Sieve
scripts.

<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.10 or earlier:
if you export news via the IMAP server, you'll have to change your
"<tt>newsfeeds</tt>" file to contain
<pre>collectnews!:*:Tf,WR:collectnews</pre>  The format of the
input to collectnews has changed.

Duplicate delivery suppression is now required for Sieve.

<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.6.1 or earlier
(including 1.5.x!): the quota and user directories are now hashed by
the first character of the username.  This is to reduce the number of
entries in any given directory. It doesn't do a great job (and in some
cases it will do a really poor job) but as a quick hack it shouldn't
make things worse.  Optionally, the data partitions can also be hashed
by enabling the "hashimapspool" option.

<p>You must hash your directories using the "<tt>dohash</tt>" script
in the tools subdirectory.  (If you want to hash your mail spool, be
sure to set "hashimapspool" before running "<tt>dohash</tt>".)  This
must be run as the Cyrus user. Be sure to stop mail service while
converting. Doing this in single user mode is probably the safest.

</ul>

<h3>Upgrading from 1.5</h3>
<ul>
<li> Upgrading from the Cyrus IMAP server version 1.5 or earlier:
libsasl is now required.  Configuring SASL to work may be a chore,
especially if you use shadow passwords.

<li> An ANSI C compiler is now required.  gcc should work fine and can
be acquired from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html</a>.

<li> Make sure to read the upgrading instructions under 1.6 above.

<li> Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires deleting the delivered
database.  Remove the file delivered.db in the configdirectory and make a
directory called "deliverdb" in the configdirectory.  This may cause some
duplicates to get through.

<li> Upgrading from 1.5.14 or earlier requires removing the PTS cache
database (if the AFS PTS group support is used, which is not the
default).  The PTS cache is in /var/ptclient/ptscache.db, and you
should remove it. This is because the format for the PTS cache for
IMSP has changed.  If you use AFS ACLs, IMSPd, and IMAPd on the same
machine, make sure you have version 1.5a5 of the IMSP server for this
version of the IMAP server.  (If you don't have IMSP, or AFS, don't
worry about it.)

</ul>
