info-cyrus mailing list

    We run a mailing list for users of Project Cyrus software. The
    info-cyrus@andrew.cmu.edu mailing list exists for the discussion of
    this server and other Cyrus software. Send mail to
    info-cyrus-request@andrew.cmu.edu to subscribe. (This list is managed
    by a person, so do not expect an immediate resposne.) 

    An archive is availible via anonymous IMAP at
    imap://cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu/archive.info-cyrus. 

    Unfortunately, no HTTP-accesible archive is availible at this time. 

    We hope to move the list to a software list manager in the near future.
