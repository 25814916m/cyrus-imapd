                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server

The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior required by the
IMAP4rev1 specification.  (The CAPABILITY command now returns
X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to advertise this bug.
This will be fixed in a future release.)

If a client tries to FETCH or UID FETCH a BODY[] attribute from a
netnews-format mailbox, the server truncates the message by one character
for each line in the message (due to LF/CRLF conversion).

Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part of
groups may be granted access to mailboes if ptclient has failed.

LIST NIL *.% causes the current imapd process to hang.


Please report bugs to cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu.  Be sure to include
system type, compiler used, and the options passed to configure.  Patches
are deeply appreciated as well.
