q's:

why does checking the sieve script put it in a temporary file?  if
it's a correct sieve script, we're just going to end up with it in
the user's directory---why don't we start with it there? - leg 9/29/99

does authenticating leak memory?  (mechanism name parameter in yacc
not freed?)
	- leg 9/29/99

document the sieve quotas in (- leg):
	imapd.conf
	sieve.html (yet to be written)

what about script size? -leg

countscripts is woefully inefficient

putscript doesn't atomically rename scripts
